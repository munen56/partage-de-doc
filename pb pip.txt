I'm new to Python and I am trying to install it on Windows. I am starting to use it because I have to set-up a watch service for a Windows folder, and then update a database when there are changes in that folder. Searching online has led me to "Watchdog".
I am trying to install csvkit and watchdog, but I have had no success; pip and easy_install are both not doing anything.

l'ajouter au path avc
C:\>set Path=%Path%;"C:\Users\Utilisateur\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts"

pui executer pip (sans >py pip etc...)

Running Python 3.3.0 x86.
Windows 7 Professional
Installed pip and distribute using msi.
When running Python command shell: 
Input:
pip install watchdog

Output:
File "<stdin>", line 1
    pip install watchdog
              ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Normal command prompt: 
Input:
python pip install watchdog  

Output:
python: can't open file 'pip': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

The solution below, as mentioned by Breakthrough, is correct:
Input:
pip install watchdog 
But I received the error output because I was missing my Scripts folder in the Environmental Variables.
Output:
'pip' is not recognized ans an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
Adding C:\Python\Scripts solved it.
